| Documentation                                                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Channels](../how-to.v2/use-channels-api)             | This example shows you how you perform simple inter-process communication via the Channel API |
| [Console App](../how-to.v2/simple-console-app)                | This application demonstrates a simple way to connect to the OpenFin runtime environment. |
| [IAB](../how-to.v2/use-inter-application-bus)                 | This is a simple example that shows how to use the IAB api to send messages between applications. |
| [Interop](../how-to.v2/fire-intents)                          | This is a simple example that shows how to use the InterOp API to fire intents that will be picked up and processed by the OpenFin Workspace InterOp Broker. |
| [Simple Connect](../how-to.v2/simple-console-app)             | A simple example showing how to connect to the OpenFin runtime. |
| [Snapshot Source](../how-to.v2/save-load-snapshots)           | This example demonstrates creating a snapshot source client in your platform and calling it from a C# application. |
| [Use Notifications Proxy](../how-to.v2/use-notifications-proxy) | An example that shows how a native app can connect to a platform app via channels and send notification requests to it. This platform app is then responsible for creating the notifications. The advantage of this is faster development, less code upkeep on the part of the native app developers, as all updates to notifications can be implemented in the platform app itself. Furthermore, the platform app can service the needs of multiple native apps. |
| [Unit Testing](../how-to.v2/unit-test-example)                | An example showing how to create unit tests for OpenFin Channel API and InterOp. |
